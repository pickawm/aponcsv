# Sample Visualizations
The graphs and infographics included on this page provide a glimpse of the kind of processing to come. Where and when did Eudora Welty appear in the newspaper? How did the timing of articles relate to events in Welty's life? What type of articles were written about her and her work? 

While there are so many more articles to add to this project, it's possible to beign to delve into these questions via a capsule collection. The 171 articles on *The Shoe Bird* are the most complete, that is these are all the articles on *The Shoe Bird* that I have found, across several databases and other sources, and so represent a capsule of data that can be considered on its own, as well as being extrapolated to the collection as a whole.
